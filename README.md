# Working with child processes on Node 

It all started with a question, how do I execute a script on a remote server? I finally figured it out, although, I still need to some in-depth research into

1. [child-process]() in Node
2. Inter Process Communication (IPC) in Node

Right now, the code in this repository is bound to change and that's okay with me. All I just need to refine it. Please checkout the other branches, which have code that I have further expanded upon.

## Dependencies

You must have

1. NodeJS 18.x.x or better
2. PNPM 8.12.0 or better
